# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive technical debt audit and recovery plan for the SoccerTimeApp Android application. The app currently has several technical issues including inadequate permission handling, problematic background service implementation, and potential unused code that needs systematic identification and cleanup.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Permission Management Overhaul

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to properly request and manage permissions at launch and during runtime, so that all features work reliably without permission-related crashes or failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL check all required permissions and their current status
2. WHEN any required permission is denied or revoked THEN the system SHALL request permission again with proper user messaging
3. WHEN a permission is permanently denied THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance to the user on how to enable it in settings
4. WHEN the app resumes from background THEN the system SHALL re-verify all permissions and handle any changes
5. IF notification permission is required for background service THEN the system SHALL request it with clear explanation of why it's needed
6. IF battery optimization permission is needed THEN the system SHALL request it with proper user education about background functionality

### Requirement 2: Background Service Architecture Cleanup

**User Story:** As a user, I want the background timer functionality to work reliably without crashes or inconsistent behavior, so that match timing continues accurately when the app is backgrounded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the background service is initialized THEN the system SHALL use a simplified, robust architecture without complex state management
2. WHEN the app goes to background THEN the timer SHALL continue accurately using a single source of truth for time calculation
3. WHEN the app returns to foreground THEN the system SHALL synchronize time without complex drift calculations or multiple timing references
4. WHEN background service encounters errors THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing the app
5. IF the background service fails to start THEN the system SHALL provide fallback functionality and clear user messaging
6. WHEN the service is stopped THEN the system SHALL properly clean up all resources and reset all state variables

### Requirement 3: Code Cleanup and Unused Code Removal

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to be clean and maintainable with no unused imports, dead code, or redundant functionality, so that the app is easier to maintain and has better performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing imports THEN the system SHALL identify and remove all unused import statements
2. WHEN scanning for dead code THEN the system SHALL identify unreachable methods, classes, and variables
3. WHEN reviewing dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify unused packages in pubspec.yaml
4. WHEN examining error handling THEN the system SHALL consolidate redundant error handling patterns
5. IF duplicate functionality exists THEN the system SHALL consolidate it into reusable components
6. WHEN reviewing assets THEN the system SHALL identify and remove unused asset files

### Requirement 4: Error Handling Standardization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle errors consistently and gracefully, so that I receive clear feedback when something goes wrong and the app doesn't crash unexpectedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL use a standardized error handling pattern
2. WHEN displaying error messages THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly, actionable messages
3. WHEN logging errors THEN the system SHALL use consistent logging levels and formats
4. WHEN handling async operations THEN the system SHALL properly catch and handle all potential exceptions
5. IF initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear recovery options to the user
6. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with appropriate fallbacks

### Requirement 5: Performance and Memory Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to run smoothly with optimal performance and minimal memory usage, so that it doesn't slow down my device or drain the battery excessively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL initialize only essential components to reduce startup time
2. WHEN managing timers THEN the system SHALL use efficient timer implementations without memory leaks
3. WHEN handling state changes THEN the system SHALL minimize unnecessary widget rebuilds
4. WHEN using background services THEN the system SHALL optimize for minimal battery drain
5. IF memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement proper disposal patterns for resources
6. WHEN the app is paused THEN the system SHALL properly release non-essential resources

### Requirement 6: Architecture Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the app architecture to follow consistent patterns and best practices, so that the code is maintainable and new features can be added reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing state management THEN the system SHALL use consistent patterns throughout the app
2. WHEN handling async operations THEN the system SHALL follow standardized async/await patterns
3. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL maintain clear separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data layers
4. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use proper dependency injection patterns
5. IF architectural inconsistencies exist THEN the system SHALL refactor them to follow established patterns
6. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL follow the established architectural guidelines
