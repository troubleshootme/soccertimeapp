# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) - SoccerTimeApp

## Overview
This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting the major architectural decisions made for the SoccerTimeApp. Each ADR follows the standard format and captures the context, decision rationale, alternatives considered, and consequences of architectural choices.

## ADR Index

### [ADR-001: Local Storage with Hive Database](./adr-001-local-storage-hive.md)
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision**: Use Hive as the primary local storage solution instead of SQLite or SharedPreferences  
**Key Rationale**: Superior performance for real-time timing operations, excellent Flutter integration, and appropriate complexity level for the app's data relationships

### [ADR-002: Background Service Architecture and Timer Implementation](./adr-002-background-service-architecture.md)
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision**: Implement hybrid background service with wall-clock synchronization for precise timing  
**Key Rationale**: Ensures sub-second accuracy over long match durations while maintaining reliable background execution and drift compensation

### [ADR-003: State Management with Provider and ChangeNotifier](./adr-003-state-management-provider.md)
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision**: Use Provider pattern with centralized AppState ChangeNotifier for state management  
**Key Rationale**: Optimal balance of simplicity and functionality for real-time updates, with excellent Flutter integration and testability

### [ADR-004: Permission Handling Strategy and Android Implementation](./adr-004-permission-handling-strategy.md)
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision**: Implement layered permission strategy with progressive enhancement and graceful degradation  
**Key Rationale**: Ensures critical functionality while following Android best practices and providing good user experience

### [ADR-005: UI Architecture Decisions - Screen-Based with Selective Components](./adr-005-ui-architecture-decisions.md)
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision**: Screen-centric architecture with strategic component extraction only when justified  
**Key Rationale**: Maintains code locality and simplicity while avoiding over-engineering, with clear separation of user workflows

### [ADR-006: Service Layer Organization and Responsibilities](./adr-006-service-layer-organization.md)
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision**: Domain-organized service layer with single responsibility principle and dependency injection  
**Key Rationale**: Clear separation of concerns with platform abstraction and testability, without over-engineering

### Key Design Principles
1. **Offline-First**: All core functionality works without network connectivity
2. **Real-Time Performance**: Sub-second accuracy maintained throughout match duration
3. **Platform Integration**: Proper Android background service and permission handling
4. **Graceful Degradation**: App remains functional even when some features are unavailable
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with testable architecture
6. **User Experience**: Intuitive navigation with responsive real-time updates

### Technology Stack Summary
- **UI Framework**: Flutter with Provider state management
- **Local Storage**: Hive NoSQL database for session and player data
- **Background Processing**: Android foreground service with exact alarm scheduling  
- **File Operations**: Platform-specific file picker with permission handling
- **State Persistence**: Real-time synchronization between UI, background service, and database
- **Platform Services**: Audio, haptic feedback, PDF generation, and internationalization

## Decision Relationships
The ADRs form an interconnected architecture where decisions build upon each other:
- **ADR-001** (Hive Storage) enables fast persistence required by **ADR-002** (Background Service)
- **ADR-002** (Background Service) integrates closely with **ADR-003** (State Management)
- **ADR-004** (Permissions) enables the functionality defined in **ADR-002** (Background Service)
- **ADR-005** (UI Architecture) leverages patterns from **ADR-003** (State Management)
- **ADR-006** (Service Layer) provides platform abstraction for all other ADRs

## Future Considerations
These ADRs document the current state of architectural decisions. Future considerations may include:
- Cloud synchronization architecture (if network features are added)
- Advanced analytics and reporting (if data analysis features are expanded)
- Multi-platform considerations (if iOS development begins)
- Performance optimizations (as user base grows)

## Contributing
When making architectural changes that affect these decisions:
1. Update the relevant ADR with the new status (deprecated/superseded)
2. Create a new ADR documenting the new decision
3. Update this README with the new ADR and any relationship changes
4. Ensure code implementation aligns with documented architectural decisions
