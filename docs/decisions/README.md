# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains the architectural decision records for the SoccerTimeApp, documenting key design choices and their rationale.

## Overview

These ADRs capture the major architectural decisions made during the development of the SoccerTimeApp, a Flutter application for managing soccer match timing, player tracking, and match statistics.

## ADR Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Date | 
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [ADR-001](./ADR-001-local-storage-hive.md) | Local Storage with Hive Database | Accepted | 2024-01 |
| [ADR-002](./ADR-002-background-service-architecture.md) | Background Service Architecture and Timer Implementation | Accepted | 2024-01 |
| [ADR-003](./ADR-003-state-management-provider.md) | State Management with Provider and ChangeNotifier | Accepted | 2024-01 |
| [ADR-004](./ADR-004-permission-handling-strategy.md) | Permission Handling Strategy and Android Implementation | Accepted | 2024-01 |
| [ADR-005](./ADR-005-ui-architecture-decisions.md) | UI Architecture - Screen-Based with Selective Components | Accepted | 2024-01 |
| [ADR-006](./ADR-006-service-layer-organization.md) | Service Layer Organization and Responsibilities | Accepted | 2024-01 |

## Architecture Relationships

The ADRs are interconnected and form a cohesive architectural foundation:

```
ADR-001 (Hive Storage) ←→ ADR-003 (State Management)
     ↓                           ↓
ADR-002 (Background Service) ←→ ADR-006 (Service Layer)
     ↓                           ↓
ADR-004 (Permissions) ←→ ADR-005 (UI Architecture)
```

### Key Architectural Themes

1. **Real-Time Performance**: The timer accuracy requirements drive many decisions
2. **Flutter Integration**: Choices optimized for Flutter's reactive architecture
3. **Android Platform**: Mobile-specific concerns like battery optimization and permissions
4. **Maintainability**: Balance between simplicity and extensibility

## Decision Principles

These ADRs reflect consistent architectural principles:

- **Performance First**: Timer accuracy is critical for match timing
- **Platform Integration**: Leverage Android capabilities while maintaining Flutter patterns
- **Reactive Architecture**: Embrace Flutter's reactive UI paradigm
- **Testability**: Design for unit and integration testing
- **Maintainability**: Balance complexity with long-term maintainability

## Reading Guide

For developers new to the codebase:
1. Start with [ADR-003](./ADR-003-state-management-provider.md) to understand state management
2. Read [ADR-002](./ADR-002-background-service-architecture.md) for timer architecture
3. Review [ADR-001](./ADR-001-local-storage-hive.md) for data persistence patterns
4. Understand [ADR-005](./ADR-005-ui-architecture-decisions.md) for UI structure

For architectural changes:
- Consider impacts across related ADRs
- Update or supersede affected ADRs
- Maintain consistency with established principles
